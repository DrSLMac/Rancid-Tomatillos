## Introduction
- This application will allow a user to view a movie library, click on an individual movie poster to see full details of that selected movie, and watch a trailer of the selected movie. The purpose of the project was to implement a React framework, utilize React Router, and perform End-to-End testing using Cypress. 

## Learning Goals
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Technologies and Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- npm
- Node.js
- React
- Router
- Cypress Testing
- RESTful API

## Project Reflections
#### Wins
- Using React router to navigate between different views and URLs without using conditional rendering. 
- Having a loading animation appear when the user first loads webpage. 
- Develop a function that allows users to search for a movie and have the filtered movies actively change as the user's search input changes.
- Learning how to write and run tests in Cypress

#### Challenges
- Figuring out how to use React Router to render different views
- How to have the movies filter out as the user fills in the input field.
- Having only the loading page appear when the user first logs in.

## Roadmap
Future features could include:
- User would have to option to "favorite" a movie by clicking a heart on the movie poster or individual movie page
- User would be able to add a new movie
- Movie details would update over time
- User would be able to filter movies by genre
